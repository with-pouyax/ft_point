# ft_point

The `FT_POINT` library introduces a simple yet effective way to work with two-dimensional points in C. By defining a `t_point` structure, it offers a straightforward approach to handle points' x and y coordinates in various applications, ranging from graphics programming to geometric calculations.

## Overview

The `FT_POINT` library encapsulates x and y coordinates of a point into a single data structure named `t_point`. This approach simplifies the process of passing points to functions, returning them from functions, and managing them in data structures.
